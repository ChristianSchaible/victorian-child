Finding a Victorian child isn’t easy—they’re delicate, proper, and usually fainting somewhere in a parlor. Here’s a foolproof guide:

- **Check the Drawing Room**
    - Most Victorian children are hiding behind velvet curtains, clutching a stiff collar, and practicing curtseys.
- **Look for Fainting Couches**
    - If there’s a small body collapsed dramatically on one, congratulations: you’ve found one.
- **Follow the Etiquette Manuals**
    - They carry tiny books on proper manners everywhere, like backpacks of doom.
- **Listen for Gasps and Squeaks**
    - A sudden shout, cough, or polite scream usually signals a startled Victorian child nearby.
- **Check the Tea Table**
    - Nothing terrifies a Victorian child more than a spilled teacup or someone daring to eat a cookie with their fingers.

**_Pro tip:_** Keep your smartphone, glitter, or TikTok ready. You’ll need it for maximum chaos once you’ve found them.
