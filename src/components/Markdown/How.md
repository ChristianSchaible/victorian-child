Finding a Victorian child isn’t exactly easy—they’re fragile, overly proper, and probably fainting in a corner somewhere. But don’t worry, here’s your go-to guide:

- **Check the Drawing Room**  
  They love hiding behind heavy velvet curtains, clutching their lace collars, and practicing their little bows.  

- **Look for Fainting Couches**  
  Spot a tiny human dramatically passed out on one? Congrats—you’ve found your Victorian child.  

- **Follow the Etiquette Manuals**  
  They carry those everywhere. Think of them as doom-filled backpacks full of rules about forks.  

- **Listen for Gasps and Squeaks**  
  Any sudden “oh my!” or delicate cough probably means you’re close.  

- **Check the Tea Table**  
  A dropped spoon or someone daring to eat with their fingers is pure horror to them.  

**_Pro tip:_** Have your phone, some glitter, or a TikTok sound ready. Nothing sends them into a polite panic faster.
