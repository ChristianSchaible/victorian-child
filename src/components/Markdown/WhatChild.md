A **Victorian child** is basically a kid from the **Victorian era** (**1837–1901**), when Queen Victoria ruled Britain. It was a time obsessed with manners, morals, and looking proper at all times. Some key points:

- **Strict upbringing:** Kids had to be polite, obedient, and perfectly behaved—or face some pretty harsh discipline.  
- **Education and chores:** Schooling and proper etiquette were huge deals, especially for middle- and upper-class families.  
- **Limited fun:** Playtime existed, but it was usually “educational.” Even toys and games came with life lessons.  
- **Child labor:** For working-class kids, childhood wasn’t really a thing—many worked long hours in factories, mines, or as servants.  
- **Clothing and appearance:** Think pinafores, waistcoats, and collars so stiff they could probably cut glass.  
- **Fears and sensitivities:** Victorian kids were seen as fragile little creatures—easily spooked by anything “improper,” scary stories, or new inventions that made too much noise.
