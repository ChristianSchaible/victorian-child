A **Victorian child** is a kid who lived during the **Victorian era**, which was roughly **1837–1901**, during the reign of Queen Victoria in Britain. This period had very specific ideas about childhood, morality, and education. Some key points:

- Strict upbringing: Children were expected to be polite, obedient, and well-mannered. Discipline was often harsh.
- Education and chores: Formal schooling and learning proper etiquette were very important, especially for middle- and upper-class children.
- Limited leisure: Play existed, but it was often structured or morally instructive. Games, toys, and books were meant to teach lessons.
- Child labor: Unfortunately, many working-class kids had to work in factories, mines, or as servants, often in dangerous conditions.
- Clothing and appearance: Kids wore very formal clothes, like pinafores, waistcoats, and stiff collars.
- Fears and sensibilities: Victorian children were considered very delicate—both physically and emotionally. They were thought to be sensitive to “frightening” or “improper” things, like scary stories, strange inventions, or chaotic scenes.
