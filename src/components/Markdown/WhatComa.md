A **coma** is a medical state where a person is completely unconscious and cannot be awakened, even with strong stimulation. People in a coma don’t respond to light, sound, or touch and are unaware of their surroundings.

- It’s not sleep—a person in a coma is deeply unresponsive.
- It can happen due to things like serious head injuries, illnesses, or extreme shock.
- Comas can be temporary or long-term, depending on the cause.
