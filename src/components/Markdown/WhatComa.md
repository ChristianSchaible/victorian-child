A **coma** is when someone is completely unconscious and can’t be woken up—no matter how hard you try. They don’t respond to light, sound, or touch, and they’re totally unaware of what’s happening around them.

- **Not just sleep:** A coma isn’t regular sleep—it’s much deeper, and the person doesn’t wake up naturally.  
- **Causes:** It can happen after a serious head injury, illness, or major physical or emotional shock.  
- **Duration:** Some comas last only a short time, while others can go on for weeks, months, or even longer.
