Victorian children were delicate, proper, and easily overwhelmed. Their lives revolved around strict manners, endless etiquette, and fainting couches.  

Modern life? The complete opposite. It’s loud, messy, and utterly ridiculous—full of TikTok dances, livestream meltdowns, neon lights, and boba milkshakes. To a child from the 1800s, that’s not culture—it’s chaos.  

So no, **sending a Victorian child into a coma** isn’t cruel—it’s practically a public service. You’re just giving them a crash course in 21st-century overstimulation: too much sparkle, too many sounds, too much drama, all at once.  

They won’t stand a chance—_and that’s kind of the point._
