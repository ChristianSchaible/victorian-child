## What is a Victorian child?
A **Victorian child** is a kid who lived during the **Victorian era**, which was roughly **1837–1901**, during the reign of Queen Victoria in Britain. This period had very specific ideas about childhood, morality, and education. Some key points:

- Strict upbringing: Children were expected to be polite, obedient, and well-mannered. Discipline was often harsh.
- Education and chores: Formal schooling and learning proper etiquette were very important, especially for middle- and upper-class children.
- Limited leisure: Play existed, but it was often structured or morally instructive. Games, toys, and books were meant to teach lessons.
- Child labor: Unfortunately, many working-class kids had to work in factories, mines, or as servants, often in dangerous conditions.
- Clothing and appearance: Kids wore very formal clothes, like pinafores, waistcoats, and stiff collars.
- Fears and sensibilities: Victorian children were considered very delicate—both physically and emotionally. They were thought to be sensitive to “frightening” or “improper” things, like scary stories, strange inventions, or chaotic scenes.

## What is a coma?

A coma is a medical state where a person is completely unconscious and cannot be awakened, even with strong stimulation. People in a coma don’t respond to light, sound, or touch and are unaware of their surroundings.

- It’s not sleep—a person in a coma is deeply unresponsive.
- It can happen due to things like serious head injuries, illnesses, or extreme shock.
- Comas can be temporary or long-term, depending on the cause.

## Why send a Victorian child into a coma? 

Victorian children were delicate, proper, and easily overwhelmed. Their worlds were filled with strict rules, endless etiquette, and fainting couches. Modern life, on the other hand, is loud, chaotic, and completely absurd. TikTok dances, livestream meltdowns, neon lights, and boba milkshakes are basically weapons of mass overstimulation to a child from the 1800s.

Sending a Victorian child into a coma isn’t evil—it’s a service. It’s a way to introduce them to the chaos, absurdity, and sensory overload of the 21st century. Basically: too much sparkle, too many noises, too much drama, all at once. They won’t survive the shock… but they’ll never forget it.

## How to Find a Victorian Child
Finding a Victorian child isn’t easy—they’re delicate, proper, and usually fainting somewhere in a parlor. Here’s a foolproof guide:

- **Check the Drawing Room**
    - Most Victorian children are hiding behind velvet curtains, clutching a stiff collar, and practicing curtseys.
- **Look for Fainting Couches**
    - If there’s a small body collapsed dramatically on one, congratulations: you’ve found one.
- **Follow the Etiquette Manuals**
    - They carry tiny books on proper manners everywhere, like backpacks of doom.
- **Listen for Gasps and Squeaks**
    - A sudden shout, cough, or polite scream usually signals a startled Victorian child nearby.
- **Check the Tea Table**
    - Nothing terrifies a Victorian child more than a spilled teacup or someone daring to eat a cookie with their fingers.

**_Pro tip:_** Keep your smartphone, glitter, or TikTok ready. You’ll need it for maximum chaos once you’ve found them.
